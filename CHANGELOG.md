## [Main](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore)

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/2.1.0)

### Deprecations

* Core: deprecate our `Cancelled` error type in favour of Swift's built-in `CancellationError` type.
* CoreData: due to incorrectness, we're deprecating `responseInsert` (this is not `responseInsert`, see below).
* This version drops support for iOS 11 or lower.

### Improvements

* Behaviours: add keyboard avoiding behaviour (using the system provided layout guide).
* CoreData: make `SingleObjectRepository` compatible with `OptionalIdentifiable`.
* CoreData: lower the requirement of repositories to `NSFetchRequestResult` where possible.
* CoreData: repository `refresh` now asserts by default, to better warn about missing implementations.
* Core: add `requestVoid` method to network client.
* Core: default error parser now ignores `.explicitlyCancelled` (for cancelled requests).
* Core: result "cancellation" now uses Swift's built-in `CancellationError` type if available.
* Core: add privacy manifest file
* XcodeGen: added a template for shared frameworks.

### Bug Fixes

* Fastlane: ensure translations export can handle "empty" targets.
* Scripts: fix Xcode warnings for build steps without input/output files.
* Bump dependencies (Sentry to 8).
* CoreData: ensure `requestInsert` imports objects on the context's thread.
* Sourcery: fix code generation for `Self.ID` properties.
* SwiftLint: fix warnings from using deprecated rules (because we use `all`).

### Internal

* Bump copyright.

## [2.0.3](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/2.0.3)

### Bug Fixes

* Core: ensure we use localised info.plist values where possible.

## [2.0.2](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/2.0.2)

### Bug Fixes

* Fastlane: `sentry_auto_set_commits` better handles issues with Sentry API.

### Internal

* Bump internal dependencies.

## [2.0.1](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/2.0.1)

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a compilation issue with Xcode 13.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/2.0.0)

### Breaking

* Updated to Alamofire 5.0, causing some breaking changes for Network clients and related types.
* Switched to Swift's built-in `Result` type, which requires an `Error` generic parameter.
* It is recommended to use the migration script when possible, it will convert most common breaking changes.

## [1.4.4](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.4.4)

### Bug Fixes

* Result.isCancelled would return false after mapping to another result type.
* XcodeGen: ensure the "iOS Extension" template can locate it's dependencies.

## [1.4.3](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.4.3)

* Bump SentrySDK version from 6 to 7. Make sure you configure a trace sample rate! This should NOT be a breaking change, but if needed, check [their migration docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/migration/#migrating-from-6x-to-7x).

## [1.4.2](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.4.2)

### Internal

* Lint & format code, and add commit hooks to trigger these.
* Bump SentrySDK version from 5 to 6. This should NOT be a breaking change, but if needed, check [their migration docs](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/6.0.0/MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-5x-to-6x).

## [1.4.1](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.4.1)

### Improvements

* CoreData: repository refresh handlers now result in a "cancelled" error by default (until you override them).

### Bug Fixes

* CoreData: operation & save callbacks are now on the main queue by default (you can provide your own queue).
* Scripts: restore "strip architectures" build step, seems it is still needed when using certain (fat) libraries.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.4.0)

### Breaking

* Removed support for CocoaPods Rome. Switch to Alexandria with the migration script: `bash <(curl -Ls "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appwise-labs/Alexandria/convert-script/convert-to-alexandria.sh")`.

### Improvements

* XcodeGen: add support for xcframeworks, so you don't have to add them manually anymore.
* XcodeGen: add small "iOS Extension" template.

### Bug Fixes

* Fastlane: import localization files sorted by name.

## [1.3.6](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.3.6)

### Bug Fixes

* Fastlane: fix some special cases in `export_localizations` (units with no translations, etc...).
* Fastlane: do not try to merge localization xliff that does not exist (in `export_translations`).

## [1.3.5](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.3.5)

### Improvements

* Fastlane: add `sync_localizations` action that imports and then exports strings in one go.

### Bug Fixes

* Fastlane: The `import_localizations` action avoids needlessly changing the xliffs.
* Fastlane: The `export_localizations` action now preserves weblate status flags.
* Rome: fix xcodegen issue where it generated invalid projects (for fastlane & CI).

## [1.3.4](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.3.4)

### Improvements

* Fastlane: The export/import translations actions now ensure the source language is `en_devel`, to better integrate with Weblate.
* Core Data: Add some helper methods to object list repositories, such as getting all objects, the count of objects, or if there are any results.
* UI: Add some common classes such as `IntrinsicImageView` (maintains ratio) and `HairLineView` (thinnest line depending on device).

### Bug Fixes

* Fastlane: fixed Sentry set-commits step for repositories with no tags.
* Rome: revert skip project generation step on CI, it doesn't belong here.

## [1.3.1](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.3.1)

### Improvements

* Rome: Skip project generation step on CI, as it has no purpose. We assume that your project is committed along with other related files.

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.3.0)

### Breaking

* AppwiseCore now depends on Sentry 5.0, update your client initialisation code accordingly.
* The built-in build steps depend on filelists that you should provide. Check the example project for a generic set of input/output file lists.

### Bug Fixes

* UI: fix some cases where resizable UITableView headers/footers weren't sizing correctly.
* AppDelegate: replace TTY logger by OS logger (as we only support iOS 10+).

  * Use the `force_bitcode` function in `pre_compile` to ensure frameworks are pre-compiled with Bitcode.

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.2.1)

### New Features

* Fastlane: add actions for translations steps: `export_localizations` and `import_localizations`.
* Fastlane: add action for automatically linking commits to a sentry release: `sentry_auto_set_commits`.

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.2.0)

* Script: Add more scripts for the common build steps, and improve them to check for tool availability & whether it is running on CI or during an archive.
* Script: Added script & template for project generation using XcodeGen.
  * Use the `generate_project` function from `generate_project.rb` to trigger generate the necessary files and your project, based on your Podfile.
  * Include the `target-templates.yml` file, and use the `iOS App` target template to add most commonly used build steps.

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.0.1)

### Bug Fixes

* Core: rename `ViewModel.Model` to `ViewModel.ModelType` to avoid conflicts with `Model` namespace. This shouldn't impact anyone unless you were directly referencing the associated type.
* Core: fallback to CFBundleName if CFBundleDisplayName is empty.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/1.0.0)

### Breaking

* Core: add `PushNotificationType` protocol for parsing incoming pushes.
* Deeplink: add shortcut method for opening a list of path elements.
* UIApplication: make spec compatible with app extensions.

### New Features

* New `AutoModel` sourcery template to generate `Model`-namespaced typealiases for your model types. The `AutoViewModel` template has been updated to handle this change.
* DB: Improved the propagation of errors from inside `Wrapper.map(_:)`. Accordingly, some of the `<-` operators are now throwing as well, just use `try` and `map(_:)` will catch it.

### Bug Fixes

* DB: fix another deadlock that could happen during some saves.
* AutoViewModel: fixed sourcery crash by checking for empty types.

## [0.11.3](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.11.3)

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.11.0)

### Breaking

* Core: the `Version` provided by `Config.handleUpdate(from:, to:)` and `Config.appVersion` is now an actual structured type, instead of a plain string.

### New Features

* DeepLink: you can now see if there's a scheduled route, and cancel it if needed.

### Bug Fixes

* DeepLink: fixed a bug where the internal state was wrong when switching tabs with navigation controllers (where you weren't in the first view controller).

### Internal

* Update to SwiftLint 0.28.

## [0.10.7](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.10.7)

### New Features

* Core: split off the application delegate and services into a separate subspec `UIApplication`, so that the `Core` subspec can be used in application extensions.
* Behaviours: added a new `RefreshOnAppearBehaviour`, that by default will only trigger a refresh if the appear is **not** from a pop navigation.

## [0.10.6](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.10.6)

### Bug Fixes

* DeepLink: fix a crash when opening a link if the stack was empty (i.e. on app startup).

## [0.10.5](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.10.5)

### Bug Fixes

* DB: make `Wrapper` inherit `ManyInsertable`. This means `[Wrapper]`s will be `Insertable`, which matches `AlamofireCoreData` behaviour.

## [0.10.4](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.10.4)

### New Features

* DB: `Map` (used by `Wrapper`) `context` property is now public, so you can access the context during an import.
* DB: Added a `NSManagedObjectContext.removeAll(of:)` method that uses a batch delete request. Note: this delete won't automatically trigger an update of your context.

## [0.10.3](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.10.3)

### Bug Fixes

* AutoViewModel: better support for nested (and other) types.

### New Features

* Network: better parsing of structured errors, and store the underlying error should you need it.

## [0.10.2](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.10.2)

### New Features

* Core: Add a new network shortcut for loading a `Decodable` object from JSON.

### Bug Fixes

* DB: fix insert requests with custom serializers and/or non-default databases, using the shortcut `requestInsert` method.

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.10.0)

### Breaking

* DB: Removed the `Many` wrapper structure (for `Array`), as Swift no longer needs this (since 4.1). You can simply use `[MyStuff].self` instead of `Many<MyStuff>.self` during insert calls.

### New Features

* Core: translate the user visible errors (such as unauthorized).
* Core: added more network shortcut methods such as `requestJSON` and `requestString`.

## [0.9.2](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.9.2)

### Breaking

* DB: The `Importable` and `ManyImportable` protocols are back due to limitations in Swift.

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.9.0)

### Breaking

* DB: AlamofireCoreData has been replaced by a built-in solution. This means that:
  * ~~The `Importable` and `ManyImportable` protocols have been merged into the `Insertable` and `ManyInsertable` protocols respectively.~~ This change was undone in 0.9.1 due to limitations in Swift.
  * There's no longer a `responseInsert` call where you can provide your own `NSManagedObjectContext`.
* Network: remove the old `responseInsert` functions where the completion block accepted a `NSManagedObjectContext` parameter. This has been replaced by the `didImport` functions on `Insertable` types. (see version [0.8.7](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AppwiseCore/releases/tag/0.8.7))
